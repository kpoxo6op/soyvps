# About

This repository manages a VPS for WireGuard access to a home Kubernetes cluster in Azure New Zealand North region.

## Project Rules

- Find elegant solutions by re-using existing code if possible. When not possible, create simple solutions with minimal code.

- Follow GitOps approach with Terraform. Use Azure CLI commands only as a fallback when necessary.

- Create concise README files in each folder explaining the purpose and design decisions. Focus on why something exists, not just describing what it is.

- Add the relative path as a top comment in each file.

- Keep code uncommented by default. When comments are necessary, use a single block comment at the top of the code section.
