# About

This repo is to manage VPS for wireguard access to home k8s cluster m in Azure
New Zealand North region.

## Project Rules

Most important rule

- find elegant solution by re-using existing code if possible, and if
  not, then do not create a complicated solutions, keep it simple with minimum
  amount of code

- strictly follow gitops approach with fallback to CLI commands in worst case. Use terrarorm and azure CLI as fallback

- Write very concise README.md in each folder explaining why something exists.
  Aim to help developer to undertand what and why, dont just bluntly describe.
  Explain non standard decisions and hacks made as en example


- Always add relative path as the top comment to each path

- Never comment your code unless I ask to do saw. As last resource put the single big block comment on top of the code block
