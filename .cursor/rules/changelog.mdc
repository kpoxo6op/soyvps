# Changelog Generation Instructions

Please analyze our conversation and previous requests and additional comments
which i will provide in current message and prompts and generate a concise,
product-focused changelog entry that:

1. Summarizes the main functional changes
2. Highlights any new features or improvements
3. Uses bullet points for multiple changes
4. Keeps technical details minimal unless they impact users
6. The amount of change log records can vary from 1 to any amount you find
   rielevant, please dont inflate the amount of records for no reason. For
   example, if you make only one change, dont make up 10 records, do only one.
7. Ignore all changes from previous changelog entries and previous commits  
8. Follows the format:

type(scope): description

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- improve: Improvements to existing functionality
- docs: Documentation changes
- refactor: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features

Example format: feat(auth): Add social login with Google
- Implemented Google OAuth integration
- Added user profile sync
- Simplified login process

Please provide the result as git commands and save it as bash script commit.sh:

git add . git commit -m "<changelog entry here>" git push origin main

Note: The commit message should be clear, concise and describe the changes in a
way that makes sense for other team members and future reference.

Important : please dont change this file, treat it as a commands for the work
you should do. Output a command to be run in the commit.sh file.

Output command to run commit.sh file

```shell
chmod +x commit.sh
./commit.sh
```
