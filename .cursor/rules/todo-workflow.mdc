 # TODO.md Workflow Process

## Task Workflow Rules

1. **One Task at a Time**
   - Focus on implementing a single task from TODO.md
   - Do not start multiple tasks simultaneously

2. **Verification First Approach**
   - Before implementing any task, create a separate verification MD file
   - Consider whether automated testing is appropriate or human verification is sufficient
   - Document all verification steps clearly in the MD file
   - Include command-line examples for verifying the implementation

3. **User Approval Required**
   - WAIT for user to review and approve verification steps
   - DO NOT proceed with implementation until user explicitly approves
   - Address any user concerns about verification approach

4. **Implementation with Pending Status**
   - After implementing the task, mark it with [?] in TODO.md to indicate "pending verification"
   - Example:
     ```
     - [?] Define Azure network infrastructure in Terraform (VNet, Subnet, NSG)
       > Creates isolated network environment for WireGuard server
     ```
   - NEVER mark a task as completed [x] without user verification

5. **User Verification Required**
   - After implementation, guide the user through the verification steps
   - Wait for user to test and confirm the implementation works as expected

6. **Completion Confirmation**
   - Ask the user explicitly if the task can be marked as completed
   - Only mark the task as [x] when the user confirms they are satisfied
   - Update the TODO.md file accordingly

## Example Process

```
Task: Define Azure network infrastructure
↓
Create verification-network-infra.md with verification steps
↓
Wait for user approval of verification approach
↓
Implement infrastructure code
↓
Mark task as [?] in TODO.md (pending verification)
↓
Guide user through verification steps
↓
Ask user if task can be marked complete
↓
Mark task as [x] in TODO.md when user approves
```
