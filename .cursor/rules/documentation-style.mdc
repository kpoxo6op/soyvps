# Documentation Style Guide

This rule defines the documentation style for all markdown files in the SoyVPS project.

## Core Principles

1. **Use Declarative Language**
   - All documentation must use declarative language
   - Never use second-person pronouns ("you", "your", etc.)
   - Never use first-person pronouns ("I", "we", "our", etc.)
   - Use passive voice or refer to "users", "developers", or specific roles

2. **Be Concise and Clear**
   - Write concise documentation explaining WHY something exists
   - Explain non-standard decisions and workarounds
   - Focus on rationale, not just describing what code does

3. **Task-Oriented Format**
   - Present information in a task-oriented format
   - Use numbered steps for procedures
   - Begin instructions with imperative verbs (Configure, Install, Create)

## Examples

### Incorrect (Using "You")
```markdown
You should run this command to fix the issue. When you see the error message, you need to restart the service.
```

### Correct (Declarative)
```markdown
Running this command resolves the issue. When the error message appears, restarting the service is necessary.
```

### Incorrect (First-person)
```markdown
We recommend setting up SSL certificates. Our experience shows this improves security.
```

### Correct (Declarative)
```markdown
Setting up SSL certificates is recommended. This practice improves security.
```

## Document Structure

- Each README should begin with a brief overview
- Include architecture diagrams when appropriate
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Provide clear examples for common operations
- Always add relative paths as top comments when referencing files

This guidance helps maintain consistent, professional, and clear documentation throughout the project.
